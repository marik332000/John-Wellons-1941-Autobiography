This is an early autobiography of my grandfather, John Carter Wellons
(April 18, 1924 - July 18, 2011). I don't have the exact date, but it
looks like he wrote it sometime in the spring of 1941, around his 18th
birthday.

Until now, my grandmother had the only copy, the originally typed
document on old, deeply-yellowed paper. I snapped some pictures of it
in order to preserve it digitally, so that perhaps someday my own
children, and so on, will be able to see it.

I entered it exactly as it was written, except to correct a couple of
minor typos that were probably difficult to correct with a typewriter.
